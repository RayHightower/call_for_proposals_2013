# My Talk Title: Building iOS Apps With RubyMotion

RubyMotion is a tool that lets Ruby developers write native iOS apps using the Ruby language. It's based on MacRuby which is an implementation of the Ruby language for Mac OS X. This talk will introduce RubyMotion with some simple live code demos and a twist of TDD. The level is introductory; you don't need to know Ruby or iOS to attend.
